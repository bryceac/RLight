<dl>
<dt style="font-weight:bold">Can I use this theme without RDarkness?</dt><dd>As it is now, that cannot be done. According to the [http://wiki.habariproject.org/en/Parent_and_Child_Themes Habari Project Wiki], the parent must be present. However, if you wish to use it as a standalone theme, which I do not recommend, you can copy all the PHP files from RDarkness to this themes folder, but modifications will need to made.</dd>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">What benefits do I have of using this as a child theme?</dt>
<dd>The biggest benefit, in my opinion, is that any updates applied to the RDarkness, aside from the stylesheet, will automatically be applied to this theme as well, which means there is no need to update, aside from the parent theme.</dd>
